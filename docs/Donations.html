<p class="roots-ex">Welcome to Verum Roots. Verum roots generates a list of 12 charities that stay relevant to the news
    each month.
    Each subscriber, after donating their one dollar per month, can select the charity where they want their money to go
    to.
    Every day you log in, you receive one seed which counts as a vote as to where you want your money to go to. At the
    end of the month,
    Which ever charity has the most seeds, will receive the sum of the money donated from people like you! </p>
